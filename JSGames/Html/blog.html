        <h3><u>making the website</u></h3>
        <p>I started this project because i wanted to learn how to get better at Javascript. What i discovered however,was that my knowledge of HTML and CSS was seriously lacking. I spent the majority fist day of this project on reviewing the learning material i had studeid in the past . Then i proceeded to open vscode, and start coding. firstly, i made the html and css files. i will spend the first few days on making the website <i>pretty</i> and <u><b>Cool</b></u>.</p>

        <p>i wanted to get the navigation bar working first, as this would allow me to switch between the different webpages.for this, i looked up a tutorial and stumbeled upon a very extensive guide on W3 schools.com.</p><br>

        <h3><u>making the website</u></h3>
        <p>Today i worked on making the 'Blog' section more pretty. I messed around with the padding in order to center the blog section and addded a border. </p><p>Nextly, since i think it looks nice, i added a border to the navigation items. After that i decided to add a background image. i couldn't figure out how to change the opacity of the background image. eventually i found a css property that made the background look okay.</p>

        <h3><u>games tab</u></h3>
        <p>Feeling pretty bad from getting covid, but hey, how much physical energy does one really need to write html and css am i right?<br>
            Today i worked on making the  games tab. I created div elements with names of supposed games i am going to write in javascript, and gave them an image that says "coming soon". I had difficulties with getting them in the right place, because i wasn't quite sure which elements to use. After 20 minutes of figuring out the 'display' property i finally got the images in the right place, with the title of the game at the top of the image. The only thing left to do was to add the necessary elements to make the image and title clickable so it could take me to the desired game. </p><p>Come to think of it, i can just copy paste this code to the "other" tab (i which i will make non-videogame programs) since i will be using the same format. How handy...</p>


        <h3><u>finishing the website</u></h3>
        <p>I have stopped keeping track of the days, since i'm not actually woorking daily on this website. the markup is done, the website looks nice and i think it's time for the first game! The first game i started with was <a href="/Html/snake.html"><b></b>Snake</b></a>. i followed a tutorial on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Azlj0f9vas">(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Azlj0f9vas)</a> , looked up the terms i didn't understand and personalised the code with some of my own elements. it actually took me about 2 days to do this, since following the tutorial was going pretty slow . next week i'm making "coinflip"</p>

        <h3><u>coinflip</u></h3>
        <p>For making the coinflip application i used a website <a href="https://sebhastian.com/coin-flip-javascript/">(https://sebhastian.com/coin-flip-javascript/)</a> in which i found all the information to make the coinfllip app. This turned out to be more difficult than excpected, since it used @keyframes (a way to animate an image/drawing on a website) to animate the flipping coin. I'm pretty sure i  need to learn how to use @keyframes for a javascript class i'm taking at school, so it works out. i again personalised the code by making the coin a certain yellow. i'm not 100 percent happy with the result because the coin looks kinda janky, but that's okay. onto the next program! </p>

        <h3><u>Calculator</u></h3>
        <p>today i felt like making a Calculator app and i'm very happy with the reult. i looked around on the internet for quite a bit to find a tutorial of a good looking calculator. i ended up following a youtube tutorial but attempted to build it further myself, after i realised it was pretty simple to do. I'm notquite happy witht he result yet and want to make the  calculator controllable with my keyboard. </p>
        

        <h3><u>Pong</u></h3>
        <p>i took a pretty long break from writing javascript, but felt like writing a program. i decided to write a pong game. i followed a tutorial on youtube but this code ended up not working in the end, which was pretty demoralising. i found a better tutorial, which i am planning to follow in the future. </p>

        <h3><u>Conclusion(for now)</u></h3>
        <p>Jsgames has been a pretty fun project, and this is something i will keep working on in the next few weeks. i'm hoping that in the future i'll be able to make these type of games without the help from youtube, but in programming it seems i will always need the internet to look up how to write certain code. This project has helped me better understand what's possible in Javascript. The possibilities are truly endless. </p>
